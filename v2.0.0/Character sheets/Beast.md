![[Beast_Roar.webp]]
*Their resolve fractured, the blood’s dark whispers took hold, and now they stand as something less than human—something monstrous. Where courage and loyalty once drove them, now only bloodlust and fury remain.

*In this twisted form, is a creature of pure, primal rage, a relentless terror on all who cross their path. Sharp claws glint where hands once held weapons, and a savage strength pulses through their frame, transforming every instinct into one of ruthless violence. Their former comrades may see fragments of the hunter they once knew, but they will have to steel themselves—no mercy will be given, nor will any plea for salvation reach the beast’s ears."*
