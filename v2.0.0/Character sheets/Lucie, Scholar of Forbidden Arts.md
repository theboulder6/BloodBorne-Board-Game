*"A reclusive figure with hollow eyes and ink-stained hands, Lucie was once a scholar in the depths of Byrgenwerth, drawn to the mysteries hidden within the arcane and beyond. Despite the warnings of her mentor Willem, Lucie hungers for the power that only the eldritch realms could offer, the power to transcend this world which keeps her trapped. The call of forbidden magic drew her deeper into the arcane, and now she wields powers that most hunters would call unnatural. Yet, as she prepares to descend into Yharnam’s catacombs, she feels a nagging dread that these arts may demand a price she has not yet paid. Her gaze lingers on the faint runes burned into her skin, marks of past rituals—each one a reminder of the unseen horrors that she cannot outrun."
