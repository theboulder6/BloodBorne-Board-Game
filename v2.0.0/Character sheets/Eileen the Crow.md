*"Silent as the shadows and twice as deadly, Eileen moves through Yharnam’s streets with practiced ease, though each step feels heavier than the last. Known as the 'Crow of Cainhurst,' she has hunted for years, her feathered mantle trailing behind her like a specter of death itself. Wielding twin daggers with precision, she ends her foes swiftly and without mercy—but tonight, her hands falter ever so slightly. She feels the weight of her years, a quiet dread that her age may one day slow her enough to let the beasts catch her. As she descends, blades ready, she can only hope her experience outweighs her fading strength."
