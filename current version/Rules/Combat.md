Combat is the most common state the players will be in. During combat the hunters will be facing 1 or more monsters and must reduce all monsters HP to 0 in order to progress. As soon as all monsters have 0 HP combat immediately ends. 

When combat begins all players make a roll. Reference the speed value of the monsters in the room then build a turn order based on the speed values of the monsters and the result of the players rolls. 

players take an action, there is no map so any target is valid.

### Player turns

On a players turn they take 1 action. Available actions are 

Attack: Choose an attack on an equipped weapon, resolve its effect

Use a blood vial: Decrease your blood vials by one, increase your HP by 3

Use a hunters tool: Choose an equipped hunters tool, resolve its effect

Use an item: Choose an equipped item, resolve its effect

Calm: Decrease your beasthood by 1

### Monster turns

On the monsters turn, the monsters will have an attack with associated damage and effects listed with them. If they have more than one attack there will be a description of which order they perform the attacks in. The target of the attack is up to the discretion of the GM. (will need to revisit this as the role is phased out)
