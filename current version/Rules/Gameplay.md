The game is split into three states, Exploration, Combat and leveling up. 

The game takes place in a series of tomb rooms represented by the room cards. While in a room the players are either in a state of exploration or combat.

After the GM reads the introduction corresponding to the chosen final boss, the first room tile is revealed, The GM reads the description of the room and the players enter a state of either exploration or combat depending on the room. 

After a room is concluded the GM checks if there is one or 0 cards left in the current depth in the room stack. If 1 room is left the players have a choice to either skip the last room of the depth and go straight to a level up room, or to attempt to complete the final room of the depth. if 0 rooms are left the players must enter a state of leveling up before continuing.
