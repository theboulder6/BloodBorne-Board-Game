*"Though called 'Father,' Gascoigne is no priest; his calling lies in the hunt, baptized in blood and sworn to Yharnam’s protection. The ruby-red locket he wears—filled with locks of his wife and daughters’ hair—rests close to his heart, a fragile tether to the family waiting for him at dawn. Known for his raw strength and the booming precision of his blunderbuss, Gascoigne grips the locket a little tighter tonight. The moon is full, and whispers of the blood’s curse weigh heavily on his mind. He knows the beasts won't be his only foe in the depths."*
