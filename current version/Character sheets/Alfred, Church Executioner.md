*"A man of fervent faith and righteous fury, Alfred is an executioner bound to the Church’s mission of eradicating the vile bloods. Clad in white and gold, his massive hammer swings with righteous zeal, each strike intended to purify the blasphemous. Yet, doubts gnaw at him—what if his actions aren't enough to purify his own soul which bears the same curse he condemns? As he stands on the precipice of Yharnam’s catacombs, the shadows seem to whisper his name, dredging up fears of damnation he dares not voice. Tonight, the weight of his faith and fear hangs heavy as he readies his weapon to face the darkness below."*
