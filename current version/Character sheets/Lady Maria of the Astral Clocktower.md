*"A striking figure clad in dark, tailored armor, Lady Maria wields her cursed katana with unmatched grace, her every movement a dance honed by years of discipline. Once a protégé of Gehrman, the First Hunter, she abandoned her role in Yharnam, hoping to leave behind the bloodshed and secrets she’d sworn to protect. Yet the hunt calls to her still, like an echo in her bones, pulling her back into Yharnam’s shadows. She grips her blade tightly, feeling the weight of every life she took, every mercy she withheld, clinging to the hope that redemption might be found in the catacombs below. But a quiet dread gnaws at her—will the horrors she left behind ever truly release her?"
