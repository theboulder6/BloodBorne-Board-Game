*"Broad-shouldered and clad in scarred leather, Henrik was once one of Yharnam’s most formidable hunters, known for his unbreakable resolve and his unmatched strength in battle. But after a fateful encounter with the Daughter of the Cosmos from which he barely survived —shadows cling to him, and has abandoned his infamous saw cleaver for the Logarius wheel, a massive, wooden wheel engraved with runes. Though he refuses to speak of it, he feels the creeping touch of the Great Ones at his fingertips, an unknowable power he fears may one day consume him. Tonight, as he enters the catacombs, Henrik wonders if his strength will be enough—or if the curse will finally take him."\
