*"Though called 'Father,' Gascoigne is no priest; his calling lies in the hunt, baptized in blood and Gunpowder, sworn to Yharnamâ€™s protection. The ruby-red locket he wearsâ€”filled with locks of his wife and daughtersâ€™ hairâ€”rests close to his heart, a fragile tether to the family waiting for him at dawn. Known for his raw strength and determination, Gascoigne grips the locket a little tighter tonight. The moon is full, and whispers of the bloodâ€™s curse weigh heavily on his mind. He knows the beasts won't be his only foe in the depths."*
