*"Once a renowned hunter and founding member of the Powder Kegs, Djura was celebrated for his innovation and explosive weaponry, crafted to bring swift ends to the horrors of the hunt. His creations—the crack of rifle fire, the flare of gunpowder—marked him as a force to be reckoned with. But over time, his unrelenting violence wore on him. Djura began to see not just monsters in the beasts he hunted, but creatures twisted by suffering and loss, trapped in a nightmare beyond their control.

*Now, known as ‘Friend of Beasts,’ Djura has turned his back on the old ways, choosing mercy over slaughter. Driven by a fierce desire to end the scourge, he descends into the catacombs not to kill, but to seek answers—anything that might bring peace to Yharnam and free both man and beast from this cursed cycle.

*Though his rifle spear is as deadly as ever, Djura’s true weapon is his resolve to end the hunt, even if it means risking everything in the shadowed depths below."
