*"Once a renowned hunter and founding member of the Powder Kegs, Djura was celebrated for his innovation and explosive weaponry, crafted to bring swift ends to the horrors of the hunt. His creations—the crack of rifle fire, the flare of gunpowder—marked him as a force to be reckoned with. But over time, his unrelenting violence wore on him. Djura began to see not just monsters in the beasts he hunted, but creatures twisted by suffering and loss, trapped in a nightmare beyond their control.

*Though his rifle spear is as deadly as ever, Djura's slipping resolve has only grown over time, as has him catching glimpses of impossible multi armed creatures around corners, and hearing the faint cry of a baby in the night. Tonight he descends into the catacombs unsure if the brute methods of his beloved powder kegs have the answer or if something far more subtle is needed tonight.
