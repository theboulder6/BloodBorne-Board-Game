*"Silent as the shadows and twice as deadly, Eileen moves through Yharnam’s streets with practiced ease, though each step feels heavier than the last. Having given up the hunting of beasts years ago, she has made a name hunting a far deadlier target for the Church. Known as the 'Crow of Cainhurst,' she ends the suffering of fellow hunters who have given into the bloodlust of the hunt and no longer have humanity tethering them to this world. Tonight, her hands falter ever so slightly. She feels the weight of her years, a quiet dread that the mission the church has put her on was all in vain. As she descends, blades ready, she can only hope her experience outweighs her fading strength."
