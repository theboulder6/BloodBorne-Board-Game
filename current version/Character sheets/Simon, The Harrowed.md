*"Known among hunters as 'the Harrowed,' Simon wears his melancholy as plainly as his torn cloak, the scars of past hunts etched deep in his weary gaze. Once a scholar and healer, he took up the hunt not for glory or zeal but in search of understanding, burdened by a desire to uncover the truth behind Yharnam’s curse. His skill lies not in brute force but in precision and patience; his slender bow whispers death from a distance, sparing him from the close horrors of the hunt. Yet, with each step into the catacombs, Simon questions if knowledge is worth the nightmares that trail him. His hand trembles faintly on his bowstring, wondering if the answers he seeks will come at the cost of his sanity—or his soul."
