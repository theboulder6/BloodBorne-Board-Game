*"A striking figure clad in dark, tailored armor, Lady Maria was once a protégé of Gehrman, the First Hunter, but long ago she abandoned her role in Yharnam, hoping to leave behind the bloodshed and secrets she’d sworn to protect. But, like an echo in her bones, tonight she finds herself drawn back into Yharnam’s shadows. She clutches the blade of her former master tightly, feeling the weight of every life she took, every mercy she withheld, clinging to the hope that redemption might be found in the catacombs below. But a quiet dread gnaws at her—will the horrors she left behind ever truly release her?"
