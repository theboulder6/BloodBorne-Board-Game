*"A man of fervent faith and righteous fury, Alfred is an executioner bound to the Churchâ€™s mission of eradicating the vile bloods. Clad in white and gold, his massive hammer swings with righteous zeal. Yet, he bears a dark secret, a childhood encounter has left his souls scarred by the very mark he swore to eliminate. As he stands on the precipice of Yharnamâ€™s catacombs, he fears he will have to rely upon his curse to survive. Tonight, the weight of his faith and fear hangs heavy as he readies his weapon to face the darkness below."*
