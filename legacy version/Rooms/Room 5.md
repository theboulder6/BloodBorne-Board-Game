*As you step into the chamber, a strange, disquieting sensation prickles at the edges of your mind—a creeping, nauseating feeling that makes your skin crawl and your heart pound faster. The air feels heavy, thick with an invisible weight pressing down on you, and a faint, distorted melody hums at the edge of your hearing, chilling and alien.

*With every step, the feeling intensifies, and a maddening heat begins to pulse behind your eyes, clawing at the edges of your sanity. You feel a terrible urge to scratch, to scream, to run—but the source of the dread remains hidden in the dim shadows around you.

Holy blade, Bergenwerth, church to recognize the touch of the Winter Lanterns and pass both checks. 

A. Attempt to steel your nerves and resist the feeling

*As the oppressive, alien melody grows louder, clawing at the edges of your mind, you feel a wave of unnatural panic tighten around you like a vice. Whispers fill your ears, half-formed words and shrill, discordant notes, pulling at the deepest recesses of your mind, urging you to surrender to a frenzy unlike any you’ve felt before.

Pass:
*But with a deep, grounding breath, you push back against the rising madness. You feel the cold stone beneath your feet, the weight of your weapon in your hands—focusing on these familiar things, you find the strength to clear your mind. The whispers begin to fade, their grip on you loosening, though faint traces linger at the edge of your hearing.*

Fail:
*A wave of panic crashes over you, all thoughts scattering as a strange, gnawing fear settles in. You see fleeting visions—your own hands covered in blood, walls crawling with eyes, faces from memories twisted and grotesque. Every nerve screams to flee, but your body feels sluggish, rooted to the spot, defenseless against the whispers burrowing into your mind. 

*As the song reaches its peak, your strength falters. You feel something slipping—a piece of your mind left behind in that haunting melody, replaced by a hollow sense of dread that lingers even as the song fades.

B. Frantically search for the source

*The maddening hum intensifies, gnawing at your thoughts with each step further into the room. Desperation spurs you forward as you scan the shadows, eyes darting across walls and corners, searching for the unseen terror that’s clawing at your mind. The whispers grow louder, insistent, as if taunting you to find them before you lose yourself entirely.

*Then, just at the edge of your vision, you spot them—figures shrouded in shadow, standing still in the corner. Now that you enemy is seen the madness in your mind is replaced with fear of the creature in front of you.

*Out of the shadows the creatures emerge and before you is a grotesque mockery of life. Their bodies resembling twisted marionettes, limbs unnaturally thin and stretched, swaying rhythmically to an eerie, discordant tune, hummed through unseen lips. Where the head shouls be is instead a disturbingly large, a bloated mass wrapped in a slick, translucent veil, beneath which you can see dozens of bulbous, unblinking eyes that stare out, each one fixed on you with a penetrating, alien awareness.*

*The Winter Lantern moves slowly, methodically, but with a terrifying sense of purpose, as if savoring each step closer. In its presence, an oppressive, suffocating dread fills the air, pressing in on all sides, whispering that there’s no escape from its relentless, maddening gaze.*
