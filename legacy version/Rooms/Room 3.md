Before you stands the Altar of the Kin, a strange structure adorned with unrecognizable symbols that shimmer with an ethereal glow. A swirling mist dances atop the altar, beckoning you closer, whispering secrets just beyond your reach. The very atmosphere seems to pulse with life, as if the altar itself hungers for your attention.

*Suddenly, the air crackles with a strange energy, casting long shadows that twist unnaturally across the walls.

*From the depths of the darkness, a low, melodic hum begins to rise, vibrating with an unsettling harmony. Shapes begin to coalesce within the shadows, grotesque, bulbous, oily. These shapes emerge, their forms elongated and disjointed.

*With azure skin stretched to breaking over thick frames, their faces are obscured by veils of shimmering light, leaving only hollow, starry voids where eyes should be. They glide toward you, moving with an unsettling grace, each step accompanied by a whisper of ancient incantations that weave through the air like threads of fate.

*The minions extend their elongated, claw-like fingers, beckoning you forward with an insidious allure. A chilling melody resonates from their mouths, a siren's song promising transcendence... or madness.
