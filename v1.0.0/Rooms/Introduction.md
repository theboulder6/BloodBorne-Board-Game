*The streets of Yharnam are cloaked in mist, thick and unyielding, as if even the air itself dreads what lies below. Pale gaslights flicker, casting long, spectral shadows over the cobblestone streets, and the scent of burning incense mingles with the tang of old blood, the pale moon above half-hidden behind a veil of storm clouds.. Tonight, the city is restless, the hunt is on. The familiar calls of beasts echo distantly, blending with the faint, mournful chanting of the Healing Church clergy who pray behind bolted doors.

*In night's past you would be out, prowling the streets, keeping the beasts at bay, yet tonight you stand with a small group of hunters in the sanctum of the chalice chapel. The cold stone walls are lined with statues of grim-faced saints, eyes cast downward bearing witness to the forgotten sin. In the center of the gathering, an elder hunter—face hidden by a hood, voice rough as gravel—speaks only in clipped sentences, eyes betraying a rare hint of fear.

*“Tonight, we descend,” he mutters. “Into the catacombs, as ordered by the Guild. None have returned, and still, they command us to press onward.”

*The door to the catacombs looms, half-open, and from the inky darkness beyond, a damp, heavy air seeps out—a scent of decayed incense, stale blood, and something else, something strange and ancient, like ash carried on an unseen wind. Beneath these stones lie secrets buried since Yharnam’s founding, and tonight, it has been decided, these secrets will be dredged up.

*The elder hunter’s gaze scans each of you, his eyes hollow yet resolute. He nods and gestures toward the descending stairway, his voice little more than a whisper.

*“Keep your wits and weapons ready. What’s in the catacombs might resist the mercy of a swift death.”

*You gather your courage and prepare to step into the dark. The echoes of distant howls fill the air, an omen of the horrors awaiting below.
