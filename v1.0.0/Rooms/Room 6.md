*As you step into the chamber, the stench of blood and torn flesh hits you like a wall. The floor is littered with the bodies of grotesque beasts, twisted and broken, their lifeless forms sprawled across the stone in a nightmarish tableau. Deep claw marks and splatters of dark, sticky blood stain the walls, evidence of a brutal and relentless fight.

*At the center of this massacre stands a lone figure, his shoulders rising and falling with each ragged breath. Clad in a hunter’s gear, his coat torn and stained, the man clutches a blood-drenched saw cleaver, its jagged edge gleaming faintly in the dim light. His eyes are wild, flickering with an unsettling intensity as he stares down at the bodies scattered around him. His knuckles are white around the hilt of his weapon, and his body trembles, teetering on the edge of control.

*He looks up as you approach, his face gaunt and shadowed, He takes a step forward, his grip on the cleaver tightening, as if uncertain whether to greet you as allies or prey. You can see the bloodlust lingering just beneath his skin, threatening to take hold.

Hunter of hunters to see in his eyes that he is not as far gone as those you have brought mercy to before

A. Attempt to reach out and steady him 

*You approach the hunter, his eyes narrow, wary and wild, body coiled as if ready to lunge. But as you reach out, palms outstretched in a calming manner, your steady voice breaks through the haze of bloodlust that clouds his gaze. His grip on the saw cleaver loosens ever so slightly, and his breaths begin to slow, the primal snarl fading from his lips. He blinks, the light of recognition returning, a glimmer of humanity surfacing amid the shadows in his eyes.

*He releases a shuddering sigh, lowering his weapon just enough to meet your gaze fully. "Thank you," he murmurs, his voice rough and hoarse. "I... I nearly lost myself. The beasts… they push you to the edge." He nods to you, a look of grim gratitude in his eyes, as he steadies himself at your side.

*But just as the moment settles, a rustling sound echoes from the corner of the room. A low, pulsing glow illuminates the darkness, revealing something massive, otherworldly—a Fluorescent Flower. its body a mass of slimy, writhing limbs. Sickly blue and pallid, the creature’s elongated form pulses with an eerie, unnatural glow, its many spindly arms reaching out in jerking, spasmodic motions. The front of the creature rears up revealing lines of sharp teeth along its body while atop it all sits a pulsing alien flower.

*Edgar’s eyes harden, his grip tightening on the cleaver as he steps forward, side by side with you. "No rest for the cursed," he mutters, his voice steady now. With a fierce look, he nods to you—this time, as an ally. Together, you prepare to face the nightmare that blooms in the darkness.

B. Brace to fight another hunter lost to the blood

*As you shift into a combat stance, Edgar’s eyes narrow, a flicker of betrayal flashing across his face. His breathing quickening as he stares you down, teeth bared in a snarl. Any trace of recognition fades from his gaze, replaced by a wild, ravenous glint. 

*A low, guttural growl rumbles from his throat, his entire body tensing as he succumbs to the bloodlust simmering beneath the surface. With a violent, unhinged cry, he lunges forward, his saw cleaver roaring to life as its jagged teeth whirl, gleaming red with fresh blood.

*Before you can react he plungers a blood vial into his leg, the fatigue disappearing from his stance. His movements are swift, unpredictable, driven by pure instinct and fury. In his eyes, you see nothing but a primal, unstoppable hunger—a hunter turned predator, lost to the very blood he once used to cleanse.
