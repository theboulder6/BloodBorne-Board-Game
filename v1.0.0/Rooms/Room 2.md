*As you move through the winding passageway, a faint, wet crunching sound reaches your ears, echoing softly in the shadows ahead. Rounding the corner, you spot a figure huddled in the dim light—a man wrapped in tattered, stained rags, his back hunched, his head bowed low over something clutched in his hands. The sickly, sour scent of blood lingers thick in the air.

*At first, it’s hard to make out what he’s holding, but as he gnaws methodically, For a brief moment, you could swear it looks… human, though the shadows make it hard to tell.

*Sensing your presence, the beggar looks up, his sunken, bloodshot eyes gleaming with a desperate, animal-like hunger. “Please…” he croaks, his voice thin and ragged. “You’ve got healing blood, don’t you?” He lifts a trembling hand toward you, fingers curled and shaking, his gaze fixed on you with a raw, unsettling need.

Executioner faction to recognize him as a vile blood opening up option to attack

A. Give him vials

*As you hand over the vials, the beggar’s hands shake with eager desperation. He fumbles, almost dropping them, before plunging a needle into his arm with an unnervingly practiced motion. The crimson liquid drains swiftly, and his body seems to drink it up greedily. He lets out a shuddering, guttural sigh of relief, his sunken cheeks gaining a hint of color, his breaths deepening.

Lose 1 vial each, gain 50 echoes

*"Thank you,” he murmurs, his voice softer, almost reverent. “Yes… yes, that’s it… that’s what I needed.” His hunched frame straightens, his muscles ripple and swell beneath the ragged fabric, and you realize, with a chilling dread, that he’s growing larger. His skin darkens, twisting and stretching, eyes now glowing with an eerie, hungry light. His mouth twists into a feral snarl, revealing teeth far sharper than before.*

B. Refuse his request and press on

*You turn to leave, dismissing his plea, but the sound of his labored breathing trails after you, each breath rasping and wet. His voice calls out, breaking with desperation, “No... don’t leave me like this... I just need... one vial...”

*But as your footsteps echo down the hall, the pleas turn to something darker—an unsettling, guttural growl.

*A sickening electric crack fills the air, followed by the sound of tearing flesh and snapping bone. You turn, and where the beggar crouched now stands a hulking beast, his tattered clothes barely clinging to his twisted frame. His eyes glow with feral hunger, fixed upon you with unmistakable rage. A twisted grin spreads across his face as he lunges, a bloodthirsty snarl filling the air.



C. attack him (only if executioner present)


*You recognize this man for who he is and before he can finish his pleas you draw your weapon and plunge it into him. But instead of crumpling, the beggar's skin begins to ripple and twist, as if reality itself is warping around him. His limbs elongate and contort grotesquely, transforming him into a distorted reflection of his former self. Though he emerges as a shadowy figure, now towering yet frail, his features twisted in a haunting mask of anguish, a rasping laugh escapes his lips—a chilling sound that resonates with a sinister promise of vengeance.

*"You think you can silence me?" he croaks, his voice a chilling whisper, barely masking a deeper, more unsettling echo. "You're no better then me." "We are the night that swallows hope… and now, you shall face the darkness you've unleashed."
