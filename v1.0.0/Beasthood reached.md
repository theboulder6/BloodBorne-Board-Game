*Once a loyal companion and trusted ally, Character now stands twisted and grotesque, their former self all but erased. Where there was once flesh, fur now bristles in wild, matted patches, and their bones have warped to fit a hulking, beastly frame. Their eyes—once clear and familiar—now burn with a feral hunger, glinting in the dim light with an unnatural, blood-red glow.

*As the transformation takes hold, a guttural snarl rips through the silence, and character lunges forward, claws splayed and fangs bared, every movement a frantic rush of strength and savage fury. Any recognition they had for their allies is gone, replaced by an insatiable bloodlust. Every step closer feels like a nightmare given form, a grim reminder of the fate that awaits those who fall to the Hunt.

*The creature that was once character name is now bound only to the call of blood, and the only mercy left… is to end them.
